CEG 3120: Project 04  

Part 1 -> Dockerize It  
* CI Project Overview  
	- (what are you doing, why, what tools?)  

* Run Project Locally  
	- How to install docker + dependencies (WSL2, for example)
	- How to build a container image from the `Dockerfile`
	- How to run the container
	- How to view the project running in the container (open a browser...go to IP and port...)  

Part 2 -> GitHub Actions and DockerHub  
* Process to create public repo in DockerHub  
* How to authenticate with DockerHub via CLI using DockerHub credentials  
	- What credentials would you recommend providing?  
* How to push container image to DockerHub (without GitHub Actions)  
* __Link__ to your DockerHub repository  
* Configuring GitHub Secrets  
	- How to set a secret
	- What secret(s) are set for this project
		* Note: do not copy paste your secrets into your documentation  
* Behavior of GitHub workflow  
	- What does it do and when
	- What variables in workflow are custom to your project  
		* This may need to be changed if someone else is going to use it or you reuse it  

Part 3 -> Diagramming  
* Include a diagram (or diagrams) of the continuous integration process. A good diagram will label tools used and how things connect. This diagram would probably look best near your project description.
